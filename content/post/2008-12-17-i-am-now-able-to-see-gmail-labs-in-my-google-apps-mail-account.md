I found out today that GMail labs is available in my Google Apps mail account. Take a look in **Settings | [Labs]** and youy will find a bunch of cool labs. If you can&#8217;t see them, ask your admin to enable **New Services and Features** in the Google Apps control panel.

Hmmm, still waiting for Google Labs, such as Google Reader etc. Maybe Santa will bring those features ðŸ˜‰
