Today I enabled [2-step verification](http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?answer=175197&hl=en) in Google Apps. This means that if you want to you can use 2 factor authentication when logging in to Google Apps services such as GMail. You can&#8217;t force your users to use 2-step verification, they must opt-in themselves.

Anyway, I did opt-in with my account and downloaded the [Google Authenticator](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator) to my Android that is used for generating codes. It all work well and now I&#8217;m using 2-factor authentication for my Google account.

When you want to opt-in for 2-factor authentication you can follow this [step by step instruction](http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/static.py?page=guide.cs&guide=1056283&topic=1056284) that is available at Google.
