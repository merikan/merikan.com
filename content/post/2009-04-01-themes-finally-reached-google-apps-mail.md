title: Themes finally reached Google Apps Mail

When logging in to my e-mail account at Google Apps today I found out that they now have integrated themes into the mail service. Just select **settings** and then **Themes**, then you have a lot of themes to choose from.

Let me know, which one is your favorite theme.
