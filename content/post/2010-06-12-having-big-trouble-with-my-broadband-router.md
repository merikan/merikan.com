The last couple of days my broadband connection has gone up and down. I have a D-Link DIR-655 that has worked perfectly until a couple of days ago. It seems to reboot itself now and then and it makes the whole family go crazy. I have tried to upgrade to the latest firmware and to change a few settings but with no luck. Suppose it&#8217;s time to buy a new one?

If you have any suggestions how to fix this or can give me a recommendation, just post a comment.
