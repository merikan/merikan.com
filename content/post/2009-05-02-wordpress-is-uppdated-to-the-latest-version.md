Hi folks

I have updated this blog server to the latest version (wordpress mu 2.7.1). It all went well and this time I decided to use the wordpress built in updater. First I did a full backup of all folders and the wordpress database (just in case ;-)). Then all I had to do was to press the update button. Done!!! I’m impressed, kudos to all you wordpress developers.

I also updated all plugins that was installed except for the LightBox 2 plugin. I can’t get that to work in 2.7+ version of wordpress. I tried to install the 2.0.2 version but it didn’t work so I had to downgrade to 1.8.2.

I installed the [SyntaxHighlighter Evolved](http://www.viper007bond.com/wordpress-plugins/syntaxhighlighter/) plugin and [OpenID](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/openid/) plugin. SyntaxHighlighter Evolved allows you to easily post syntax-highlighted code to your site without loosing it’s formatting or making any manual changes. It uses the SyntaxHighlighter JavaScript. The OpenID plugin allows users to login to their local WordPress account using an OpenID, as well as enabling commenters to leave authenticated comments with OpenID. I promise to write more about OpenId and how to use it.

thats all, see ya
