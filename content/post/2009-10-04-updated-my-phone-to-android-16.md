Today I updated my ADP1 to Android 1.6. I flashed the device using an updated recovery image ([read more](http://developer.htc.com/adp.html)). The process is simple, this isÂ  how I did it.

First we need to download the radio image and the recovery image from [HTC](http://developer.htc.com/adp.html).Â  After the files are downloaded it&#8217;s time start the update. This is a two step process, first we will install the radio image and then the recovery image.

**Install the radio image:**

  1. Connect the phone to the computer and mount the sdcard.
  2. Copy the the radio image to the root folder of the sdcard.
  3. Rename the file to update.zip.
  4. Unmount the phone.
  5. Turn of the phone by holding down the red &#8220;Power&#8221; (hang up button) &#8230; then confirming with &#8220;OK&#8221;.
  6. Reboot the phone by holding down the Home button (House symbol) and and at the same time pressing the Power button.
  7. Wait for the triangel. Then hold down alt-key and and press L.
  8. Press alt+S
  9. The update process will now start. The following text will be displayed on the screen:  
    Android system recovery utility  
    E:Can&#8217;t open /cache/recovery/command</p> 
    Home+Back &#8211; reboot system now  
    Alt+L &#8211; toggle log t ext display  
    Alt+S &#8211; apply sdcard:update.zip  
    Alt+W &#8211; wipe data/factory reset
