I moved my domain to Google Apps a couple a weeks ago. It all works perfectly but Iâ€™m missing a couple of Labs services, especially the Reader. According to Google the Labs will be available in three weeks, you can find it [here](http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/static.py?page=known_issues.cs) and [here](http://groups.google.com/group/hosted-the-basics/msg/00b428a83de84af4).
