Today I discovered that Google Labs is available for Google Apps. I&#8217;m not sure, perhaps this has been available for a while without my knowledge. Today there are three products available.

  * **Google Moderator** &#8211; Google Moderator makes it easy to gather and prioritize questions or opinions on any topic from a group of people.
  * **Google Short Links** &#8211; Google Short Links allows users to easily create descriptive shortcuts to web URLs. This makes it easier for users to recall and share the locations of important documents and web sites.
  * **Google Code Reviews** &#8211; Google Code Reviews facilitates quality software development by making it easy for peers to review an author&#8217;s changes and share feedback.

If you want to activate them.

  1. Go to the dashboard.
  2. Select Add more services.
  3. Select See more services from Google Labs.

But I&#8217;m still missing my Reader. ðŸ˜‰
