title: I&#8217;m now using my Google Apps account on Android

When I bought my Android phone 6 months ago I wasn&#8217;t able to use my Google Apps account for my own domain (merikan.com). The only account that worked was my GMail account, so I have been using this until today. I wasn&#8217;t so eager to switch since i have all my IM friends connected to my GMail account but now I have changed this so it was time to do a change on my phone to.

I didn&#8217;t want to reset my phone to make that change so I did a little googling on the subject. I found this [blog post](http://www.miketec.org/serendipity/archives/10-Android-and-Google-Apps.html) that put me in the right direction. All I had to do was to run the setup wizard and to be able to run that I install the Any Cut application from the Market. Add a short cut to Setup Wizard (I had two and it was the second one ðŸ˜‰ ). I ran the setup wizard and that was it. I&#8217;m now using my Google Apps account on my Android phone.

Still have problem with Anroid Market since it can&#8217;t connect with this new account. When I run it it says: &#8220;No downloads from Android Market&#8221;. If you know how to fix this, help is appreciated.
