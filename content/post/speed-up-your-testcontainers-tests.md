This is the second part of a two part series about [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/). In this part I will among other things show you some tricks to get your Testcontainers start much faster.


# Intro
In the previous blog post, [Getting Started with Testcontainers]({{< ref "getting-started-with-testcontainers" >}}), I described what the [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) framework is and how to get started using it in your project. After using Testcontainers for a long time I learned that there are things that need to be adjusted to make it even better and faster. Below I will show some of the things that make a fantastic framework even better.

## Source code
The full source code for my example project can be found here: [https://github.com/merikan/testcontainers-demo)](https://github.com/merikan/testcontainers-demo) and the folder `faster`.


# Use the singleton pattern

I described this in my [previous blog post]({{< ref "getting-started-with-testcontainers" >}}) but it is well worth repeating. There may sometimes be a reason to use the `@Container` annotation to declare Testcontainers in our integration test classes. The disadvantage of this is that our Testcontainers will start and stop between each test class that is run, which can take a very long time. We can instead use the singleton pattern to make our Testcontainers start only once for all our test classes, and then be taken down when they are finished. 

Keep in mind that you have to deal with any side effects caused by multiple tests using the same resource. For example, by making your tests unaffected by the state of the resource or by setting the resource in the desired state for each test.


To use the singleton pattern we can create an abstract class that handles the creation of Testcontainers. 

``` java
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = RANDOM_PORT)
@ActiveProfiles("integrationtest")
public abstract class AbstractIntegrationTest {
    private static final DockerImageName MARIADB_IMAGE = DockerImageName.parse("mariadb:10.5.5");
    private static final MariaDBContainer mariadb;

    static {
        mariadb = new MariaDBContainer<>(MARIADB_IMAGE)
            .withCommand("--character-set-server=utf8mb4", "--collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci");
        mariadb.start();
    }

    @DynamicPropertySource
    static void properties(DynamicPropertyRegistry registry) {
        registry.add("spring.datasource.url", mariadb::getJdbcUrl);
        registry.add("spring.datasource.username", mariadb::getUsername);
        registry.add("spring.datasource.password", mariadb::getPassword);
    }
}
```

Each integration test class should then inherit from this abstract class to make use of Testcontainers.

``` java
public class TodoServiceImplIT extends AbstractIntegrationTest {

    @Autowired
    private TodoService uut;

    @Autowired
    private TodoRepository repository;

    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        repository.deleteAll();
    }
```

If we now run our tests, we will see that our Testcontainer is only started once, which means that we shorten the time to run our test suites significantly.


# Speed-up start time with multiple containers

In my current projects I have multiple containers in my test suites and it will take some time to start, even if it's only done once. But with some small changes we can reduce the startup time.

Let us first create an example where we start several Testcontainers and then make some changes to see if we can reduce the startup time. In order not to get misleading results, we need to run it once first to ensure that all images are pulled down and available locally. To keep the example clean and clear I am not using any properties from our started containers.

``` java 
static {
    Instant start = Instant.now();

    mariadb1 = new MariaDBContainer<>(MARIADB_IMAGE)
        .withCommand("--character-set-server=utf8mb4", "--collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci");
    mariadb1.start();
    mariadb2 = new MariaDBContainer<>(MARIADB_IMAGE)
        .withCommand("--character-set-server=utf8mb4", "--collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci");
    mariadb2.start();
    redis = new GenericContainer<>(REDIS_IMAGE).withExposedPorts(6379);
    redis.start();
    kafka = new KafkaContainer(KAFKA_IMAGE);
    kafka.start();
    sftp = new GenericContainer<>(SFTP_IMAGE)
        .withCommand(String.format("%s:%s:::upload", "SFTP_USER", "SFTP_PASSWORD"));
    sftp.start();

    log.info("🐳 TestContainers started in {}", Duration.between(start, Instant.now()));
    
}
```

If we now run one test we can see that that it takes a little less than 30 seconds to start all five Testcontainers.

```
 🐳 TestContainers started in PT29.836S 
```
Ok, time to make some changes. As we can see in  the code above we are starting our testcontainers sequentially, what if we could start them in parallel instead? Let's try that. 
We can use the Stream class for this and it will look like this.

``` java
static {
    Instant start = Instant.now();

    mariadb1 = new MariaDBContainer<>(MARIADB_IMAGE)
        .withCommand("--character-set-server=utf8mb4", "--collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci");
    mariadb2 = new MariaDBContainer<>(MARIADB_IMAGE)
        .withCommand("--character-set-server=utf8mb4", "--collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci");
    redis = new GenericContainer<>(REDIS_IMAGE).withExposedPorts(6379);
    kafka = new KafkaContainer(KAFKA_IMAGE);
    sftp = new GenericContainer<>(SFTP_IMAGE)
        .withCommand(String.format("%s:%s:::upload", "SFTP_USER", "SFTP_PASSWORD"));
    Stream.of(mariadb1, mariadb2, redis, kafka, sftp).parallel().forEach(GenericContainer::start);

    log.info("🐳 TestContainers started in {}", Duration.between(start, Instant.now()));
}
```

If we now run our test again we can see that it takes a little less than 12 seconds to start all five Testcontainers. 

```
 🐳 TestContainers started in PT11.606S
```
So we saved 18 seconds in startup time, it wasn't that bad, was it? Is there anything else we can do to make our tests faster? Yes there is, just keep reading and you will see yet another way.


# Reuse your Testcontainers

One thing that repeatedly slows me down is when I work with one test and want to run it several times. It can take a long time and I want a fast feedback loop. So let's dig deeper and see how we can solve that.

Testcontainers comes with a [preview feature](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/pull/1781) that enables us to reuse an already started Testcontainer. In short, this means that Ryuk (the clean-up mechanism that is responsible for shutting down Testcontainers after a test run) will not be started, which in turn means that our Testcontainers will not be taken down after our tests are completed. This feature can really save time during the development process! All you have to remember is to manually stop all Testcontainers when you are done. 

We have to do two things to enable this reuse. First we have to tell our Testcontainer that it should be reused,  using the `.withReuse(true)` method. Next we have to create a configuration file for Testcontainers (`~/.testcontainers.properties`) in our home directory and add the property `testcontainers.reuse.enable=true`. At the time of writing you can only have this property file in your home directory and not in the classpath, per project. But on the other hand, you probably do not want to impose such behavior on your team members or other environments, such as your CI / CD pipeline. This should definitely be optional and if it becomes possible to add it per project ,you should add it to `.gitignore` to prevent it from being propagated to your collegues and to the CI / CD pipeline.

This is how our abstract class will look like when enabling `reuse`:

``` java
static {
    Instant start = Instant.now();

    mariadb1 = new MariaDBContainer<>(MARIADB_IMAGE)
        .withCommand("--character-set-server=utf8mb4", "--collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci")
        .withReuse(true);
    mariadb2 = new MariaDBContainer<>(MARIADB_IMAGE)
        .withCommand("--character-set-server=utf8mb4", "--collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci")
        .withReuse(true);
    redis = new GenericContainer<>(REDIS_IMAGE)
        .withExposedPorts(6379)
        .withReuse(true);
    kafka = new KafkaContainer(KAFKA_IMAGE)
        .withReuse(true);
    sftp = new GenericContainer<>(SFTP_IMAGE)
        .withCommand(String.format("%s:%s:::upload", "SFTP_USER", "SFTP_PASSWORD"))
        .withReuse(true);
    Stream.of(mariadb1, mariadb2, redis, kafka, sftp).parallel().forEach(GenericContainer::start);

    log.info("🐳 TestContainers started in {}", Duration.between(start, Instant.now()));
}
```

One [problem](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/2961) that you probably will encounter is that the Testcontainer is not unique to this particular project. Since I have several Testcontainers with the same configuration in several projects, this posed a real problem for me. So let's fix this.

If we take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/blob/17b4f6c136f6f2c7dc223bad407221f62a8f0088/core/src/main/java/org/testcontainers/containers/GenericContainer.java#L364-L412), the uniqueness of the started Testcontainer is calculated based on the actual configuration. Testcontainers will then search for the hash among all current running containers with label `org.testcontainers.hash` to see if a match is found, and if so reuse this container. An easy solution to this problem is to add something to the configuration that makes this particular container unique. I have chosen to add my own label with the name `reuse.UUID` with a [unique UUID](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/) as the value.

``` java
.withLabel("reuse.UUID", "e06d7a87-7d7d-472e-a047-e6c81f61d2a4");
```

This is what it looks like in the abstract class when we activate reuse with a unique id to our Testcontainers.

``` java
static {
    Instant start = Instant.now();

    mariadb1 = new MariaDBContainer<>(MARIADB_IMAGE)
        .withCommand("--character-set-server=utf8mb4", "--collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci")
        .withReuse(true)
        .withLabel("reuse.UUID", "e06d7a87-7d7d-472e-a047-e6c81f61d2a4");
    mariadb2 = new MariaDBContainer<>(MARIADB_IMAGE)
        .withCommand("--character-set-server=utf8mb4", "--collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci")
        .withReuse(true)
        .withLabel("reuse.UUID", "282b8993-097c-4fd4-98f1-94daf3466dd6");
    redis = new GenericContainer<>(REDIS_IMAGE)
        .withExposedPorts(6379)
        .withReuse(true)
        .withLabel("reuse.UUID", "0429783b-c855-4b32-8239-258cba232b63");
    kafka = new KafkaContainer(KAFKA_IMAGE)
        .withReuse(true)
        .withLabel("reuse.UUID", "f8724ec0-2f66-4684-80cd-1b24a7399366");
    sftp = new GenericContainer<>(SFTP_IMAGE)
        .withCommand(String.format("%s:%s:::upload", "SFTP_USER", "SFTP_PASSWORD"))
        .withReuse(true)
        .withLabel("reuse.UUID", "0293a405-e435-4f03-9e4b-b6160d9e60fe");
    Stream.of(mariadb1, mariadb2, redis, kafka, sftp).parallel().forEach(GenericContainer::start);

    log.info("🐳 TestContainers started in {}", Duration.between(start, Instant.now()));
}
```

If we start our test again, it took about 11 seconds to start our containers the first time, our Testcontainers will now be reused and this time it will only take about 1 second. That's not bad, is it?

```
 🐳 TestContainers started in PT1.796S
```

This is really a performance boost to get faster feedback when running our tests. And now all we have to do, when we are done testing, is to stop our running Testcontainers.

To list all running Testcontainers:

``` sh
$ docker ps --filter label=org.testcontainers

# Runing tests in a docker container

One question that often comes up is this: If my tests now use docker containers, can the tests themselves run in a docker container? Yes they can, it is called [Docker in Docker](https://jpetazzo.github.io/2015/09/03/do-not-use-docker-in-docker-for-ci/) aka. DinD. With docker in docker, there will be new challenges such as privileged mode etc., but that's not something I intend to address here.

To run your tests locally in a docker container.
 
``` sh
$ git clone https://github.com/merikan/testcontainers-demo.git
$ cd testcontainers-demo/faster
faster $  docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock maven:3 ./mvnw clean test verify
```
